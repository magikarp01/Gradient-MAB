FIX METAMAX
Selection is based on maximum, not minimum

debug uniformAlloc and metaMax
figure out if the initial gradient descent in fitAlloc is doing everything, if the allocation is actually making a difference
if not, adjust the parameters of a() of gradDescent

try each of the algorithms with the same starting positions

for fitAlloc, only remember the past p points for regression
(accounting for every point in regression is v slow)
